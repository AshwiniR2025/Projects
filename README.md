Project: Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning with Python 
PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
We need to predict the prices of used cars. We are using the dataset from Kaggle and it contains information about used cars like 
Car brand name, year,selling_price,km_driven, fuel,seller_type,transmission,Owner.

WORKFLOW:
 
Raw data—>Data preprocessing—>Split train and test data—>Linear Regression and Lasso Regression model
   
Feed new data—>Trained linear and lasso Regression—>predict car price
